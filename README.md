## Electroanalytical Simulation Toolkit

This repository contains a Python-based toolkit for simulating various electroanalytical techniques, including
**voltammetry**, **amperometry**, and other eletro-analytics techniques.

- [x] Cyclic Voltammetry
    - [x] Reversible  (r)
    - [x] Quasi Reversible (qr)
    - [ ] Irreversible (ir)
- [x] Chronoamperometry

### Folder Structure

- `output/`: Processed simulation data and plots.
- `simulations/`: Core modules for performing electroanalytical simulations.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IsiraUdaththa/pyElectrochem.git
cd pyElectrochem/simulations
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
